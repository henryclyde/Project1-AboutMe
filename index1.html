    <h2>My Poem: Web Building</h2>
    <p class="poem">On late nights through blurry eyes<br>We build them line by line,<br>The world of web and pixels,<br>Our creations start to shine.</p>
    <p>-This is a short poem that encapsulates my late nights spent learning and focusing on web development.</p>

    <h2>My Personal Interests:</h2>
    <p>I love music, and have been playing instruments since a young age. I also love to sing, so in my spare time, I like to learn new songs on guitar and sing. John Mayer songs are what I like learning the most right now. I've just nailed down Stop This Train, and am now learning Neon, which has been tough on my hands.</p>
    <p>Another interest of mine is lifting weights. I started lifting several years ago, to put on muscle, but this hobby/pass-time has turned into a great activity that helps boost my mood and mental health, and keep me strong and healthy.</p>
    <p>My newest interest is web development, which I started focusing on several months ago, through an online curriculum called The Odin Project. It's basically an open source full stack web dev course, that many bootcamps use as a template for their curriculum. I am hoping to get a lot of practice through this class, on refining and improving my web dev capabilities.</p>

    <p>(Only 2 summer classes)</p>
